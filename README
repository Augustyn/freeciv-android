It includes Freeciv 2.6.0

If you don't need to change source code and don't need latest version simply download APK from http://civ.zielm.com

== INSTALLATION ==

Running Freeciv on desktop requires a patched version of SDL2 (with modified alpha blending). To patch SDL 2.0.4, use configure_project/SDL_modify_blending.patch. You also need Curl, SDL2_image and SDL2_ttf.

Dependency installation:

   apt-get build-dep -y libsdl1.2debian libsdl-image1.2 libsdl-ttf2.0-0 libcurl4-openssl-dev python2.7-dev
   apt-get install -y graphviz python-pip mercurial python2.7-dev git-core
   pip install Cython==0.15
   # for running web/proxy.py
   pip install tornado==3.1.1
   pip install python-for-android==0.4
   apt-get install -y python-imaging
   # if on fairly new system
   ln -s /usr/bin/aclocal /usr/local/bin/aclocal-1.13
   ln -s /usr/bin/automake /usr/local/bin/automake-1.13
   # if software renderer needed
   apt-get install libgl1-mesa-swx11-dev xvfb

Building for Android requires Android NDK with version r12b.

Configuration:
For this step only, you need Android SDK 22.6.3.
Make sure that p4a (python-for-android) is in your PATH and run:
ANDROIDSDK=<PATH to your SDK 22.6.3 installation> ANDROIDNDK=<PATH to your NDK installation> make pythonforandroid

Then, you need Android SDK >= 26. Add these environment variables:
   ANDROID_HOME=<PATH to your SDK installation>
   ANDROID_NDK_HOME=<PATH to your NDK installation>

Build and run on desktop (for debugging):
   make run

(Warning: if you break build process you may need to start again with clean repo)

Build for Android:
   make -C android debugapk
