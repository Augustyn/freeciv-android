It includes Freeciv 2.3.1

If you don't need to change source code and don't need latest version simply download APK from http://civ.zielm.com

== INSTALLATION ==

Running Freeciv on desktop requires SDL2 with modified alpha blending from http://github.com/zielmicha/SDL2. You also need SDL2_image and SDL2_ttf (from http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL_image/ and http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL_ttf/).

Known working version:

   hg clone -r 363 http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL_image
   hg clone -r 228 http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL_ttf

Dependency installation:

   apt-get build-dep -y libsdl1.2debian libsdl-image1.2 libsdl-ttf2.0-0
   apt-get install -y graphviz
   pip install Cython==0.14
   # if on fairly new system
   ln -s /usr/bin/aclocal /usr/local/bin/aclocal-1.13
   ln -s /usr/bin/automake /usr/local/bin/automake-1.13
   # if software renderer needed
   apt-get install libgl1-mesa-swx11

Don't install SDL2 from your distribution repository! It is highly probable that it will be incompatible.

Build and run on desktop (for debugging):
   make run

(Warning: if you break build process you may need to start again with clean repo)

Build for Android (put android, adb and ndk-build in your PATH):
   make -C android debug
