=== Space Race
The Space Race is a second option to win the game, besides eliminating all other civilizations.  If your spaceship arrives first at Alpha Centauri, the game is over and you have won. (However it is possible for this option to be off as a server option.)

Before you can build spaceship parts, the Apollo Program wonder must have been built by any player.  You also need specific technologies to build the different spaceship parts: see the help texts for Space Structural, Space Component, and Space Module, under City Improvements.  (If there are no help texts for these items, it probably means the spacerace server option is off for your game.)

When you have started building your spaceship, you can see it with the "Spaceship" command in the Report menu.  To see spaceships of other players, select the player in the Nations report and click "Spaceship".

If the success probability is below 100%, some fraction of the people on board may not survive the journey.  This reduces the score bonus from the spaceship, but it still counts as a win.

If the capital of a civilization is captured, a spaceship that has been launched will be lost, so defend your capital well!

TIP:  If an enemy civilization has launched a spaceship, try to quickly build a light spaceship with many propulsion units that will arrive earlier.  The only other option is to capture their capital.

===  Plague
Plague is a ruleset option, and is not enabled in the default ruleset.

When plague strikes a city, its population is reduced by one. Unless action is taken to reduce the risk of plague, this tends to act as a natural limit on city size. Rulesets which enable plague will typically have city improvements or other means to reduce the risk of plague.

The risk of plague depends on city size (overcrowding leads to insanitary conditions) and on the pollution generated in a city. Also, plague can spread via trade routes (without regard for nationality); after a city has been struck by plague, it will remain infectious to its trade partners for several turns, increasing the risk of plague in those cities by a factor depending on the size of both cities.

===  Migration
Migration is the movement of citizens from one city to another based on the relative attractions of living in each city. Whether migration is enabled is controlled by the server option `migration'; it is disabled by default.

When migration is enabled, every few turns, a citizen of each city in the game may migrate to a nearby, more attractive city, either within the same nation or even across national borders (to a lesser extent, by default).

You cannot directly prevent or direct the migration of citizens. However, you can influence the attractiveness of your cities. The following factors affect the perceived desirability of each city, in approximately decreasing order of importance. (Each factor counts for much more in the citizen's current city, as they prefer not to move without a compelling reason.)

 - City size.

 - The number of happy citizens. (To a lesser extent, unhappy and angry citizens reduce the desirability of a city.)

 - The presence of any wonder in a city will greatly increase its desirability (further wonders do not contribute except by the lesser effect of their build cost).

 - Capital cities are more attractive than other cities, all other factors being equal; in addition, citizens will never migrate out of a capital city.

 - Food surplus. (A food deficit reduces the desirability of a city.)

 - Cities that are further away are less desirable. The absolute maximum distance that a citizen is prepared to migrate is controlled by the server option `mgr_dist'.

 - Trade surplus.

 - Luxury and science output.

 - The quantity of city improvements (and wonders

measured by build cost.

 - Depending on the ruleset, a number of other factors such as government type and city improvements may increase or decrease the desirability of cities; these are noted in other sections of the help. (The default ruleset contains no such effects.)

Citizens will not migrate to cities which cannot increase in size to support them, for instance due to lack of a city improvement such as an Aqueduct. If the server option `mgr_foodneeded' is set, they will not migrate to cities which would not have enough food to support them.

Migration can even cause cities to be completely abandoned (ownership of any units being transferred to your nearest remaining city). However, cities with wonders will never be disbanded (so the wonder will not be destroyed

and the last citizen from your only remaining city will never migrate to another nation.

Several of the details of migration can be changed with the `mgr_*' server options.
